                    <h2>A Brief History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Boyertown (BASH)-TSA was founded in 1989. Joshua Pennington is the current advisor. 
The chapter has cultivated its image by hosting events, fundraisers, and performing well in all competitions.
The chapter has also had many members place as finalists in the regional, state, and national competitions in past years.
The Boyertown chapter is heavily involved with TSA and making a contribution to the club as well as the community through its events and achievements. 
</br>
Former Senior, Abigail Reigner, from BASH held the office of State President. Boyertown Alumni Joshua Famous also held state office as State Sergeant-at-Arms.

                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        BASH-TSA is recognized for its record-breaking altruism and activism at the national level. The chapter's annual spaghetti dinner is known throughout the school and is one of the more successful fundraisers throughout the year. 
		<br>
It is also important to BASH-TSA that the chapter remains involved with the school and the community. The chapter does so by participating in events such as the Homecoming Carnival, club fair, and pep rally. It also helps outside of the school by often working closely together with the local multiservice, Salvation Army, and Goodwill. 
		<br>
A large part of BASH-TSA's involvement includes fundraising for the ACS. Over $6,000 in the past three years have been donated by the chapter from their fundraising, and it has been recognized by the State Inspiration Award in 2017 and the Purple Award from 2016-18. This year, BASH TSA’s goal is to break the national ACS fundraising record, currently $10,648.

                    <h2>What TSA Means To Us</h2>
                    <p>
                      Many members of BASH TSA have been in TSA since middle school, and have stuck with it since. To BASH TSA, it is more than a club. For many members, it has helped them build long-lasting friendships. TSA gives many members a sense of belonging in an otherwise large high school. The events members compete in aren't just reflective of their skills and interests, but the character they've built within BASH TSA. During the holiday season, BASH TSA alumni often stop by the chapter's open lab sessions to say hi to their old club, as well as provide advice to current members. The BASH TSA family goes beyond competitive events; it is a lasting experience that its members never forget.
