                    <p>
                      In this technology education project, students deconstruct pieces of technology in order to understand its component parts. Through reverse engineering, students are able to see what makes things work the way that they do. Students are able to disassemble multiple products to see the engineering involved in them. This is a fun and effective product in teaching because it helps the students to visualize and interact with what they learn about.

                    <p>
                      In this project for AP Physics, students work to build a roller coaster out of paper and keep a ball rolling through it. This is done through measurements and calculations to predict how far the ball will be able to go, while also being supported by the paper structure. By doing this, students learn about conservation of energy and projectile motion while adding an exciting, hands-on element to it. Although it is a lot of work, this is a very fun project for students to build and compete together while learning and having fun.

                    <p>
                      In this math project, students write a history of a math concept and present it. Students research and present their findings of the discoveries of multiple different mathematical concepts and equations. This helps them to understand the basis of math concepts and are able to apply them better to real life situations. It is important for students to understand how certain concepts were discovered to better understand them and observe how mathematics have developed over the years. It is a fun and in-depth research project that really gets students involved.

                    <p>
                      In this project for Technology and Engineering, students use wood and popsicle sticks to build a sturdy bridge. The goal is to create a bridge that spans 36 inches and is able to support 44 pounds. To do this, students must utilize the knowledge about different types of bridges and structures. This event is a favorite among tech-ed students because they get a hands-on approach to learning about structures. Once the bridges are built, they have fun placing weights and even standing on them to see how much weight their structures are able to support. Building them is entertaining for everyone and a great learning experience.

                      In this project for Digital Communications, students are able to design and create their own T-Shirts. Students are taught how to use Illustrator and the process is started by using it to design an image. It is printed to transparency paper and placed on blue polyfilm to transfer, and the film is then used to transfer it onto a screen. After that, the screen can be placed on the shirt and ink is rolled on, creating the final result. By learning the process, students see how shirts are made and develop new skills. This is a favorite project of many students because they get to express their creativity by designing whatever image they want. Once their hard work is done, they are able to present and actually wear their creation, which is exciting for everyone.

This shows students how to use programming tools, write code, and introduce them to modern technologies, such as AIs. Students have fun programming with the skills that they have learned and even more fun using the finished AI to maintain conversations. These AIs are often impressive and show one way that programming skills can be utilized in the modern world.
