                  <p>
                    TSA is one of the premier STEM student organizations in the world, consisting of over 250,000 members across four countries and 48 states. Its rich history began in 1978 as the American Industrial Arts Student Association, before becoming the Technology Student Association in 1988. Now, TSA represents active advances in its field, providing members opportunities to competitively interact with diverse and developing fields. Consistent of a wide variety of specific competitions - its events - there's certainly no limit of what members can do in TSA. Read more about these events below.
